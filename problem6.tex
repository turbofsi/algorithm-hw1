\section{Problem VI}
Consider a light ray entering two adjacent planes of glass on a table. At any meeting surface (between the two planes of glass, or between the top glass and the air) the light may either reflect (bounce) or continue straight through (refract). In the example below, the light ray bounces 7 times before it leaves the glass plane. The light always reflects between the bottom glass and the table. How many different paths can a light ray take if it bounces $n$ times before it leaves the top glass plane? Give a recurrence relation to answer this question.

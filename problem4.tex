\section{Problem IV}
$m$ balls are thrown into $n$ bins (independently) so that each ball is equally likely to fall into any of the bins. Estimate as precisely as you can the smallest number $m$ (as a function of $n$) so that the probability of all balls falling into different bins is smaller than $\frac{1}{n^{c}}$, for a fixed constant $c>0$.
